AGENDA

Overview
- improve the header, so that it stays and solidifies in crimson, just like all the main IU websites
- work on the background image for the hero (first) section: it's supposed to resemble the VS Code Website Background ASCII animation, and we will put our own spin on it. Right now, what we have is a screen recording of my code (demo -- it most definetely could be better!)
- adjust the card spacing for mobile users (the calendar section is fine, the rest of the card elements blend vertically)
- think of a database for events? Or we can just manually update it weekly
- adjust the footer spacing and iconed links
  
- NONE of the animation works
  - get the gallery element to scroll through pictures
  - hover animation on cards

Please let me know if you have any questions! :)
