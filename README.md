WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA, folks :)

### UI / Design Improvements

- Header
  - Make the header **sticky** (remains visible while scrolling)
  - Apply a **solid crimson background** to match official Indiana University website styling

- Hero Section (Top Banner)
  - Replace the current screen recording background with a **custom animated ASCII-style background**, inspired by the **VS Code website animation**
  - Create our own version that fits the ACM brand and color scheme.

- Cards and Layout
  - Fix **vertical spacing** between cards on **mobile view** — currently, some cards blend together
  - The **calendar section spacing is fine** as is.

- Footer
  - Adjust **spacing and alignment**
  - Add or fix **icon links** (socials, GitHub, contact, etc.).


### Functionality & Features

- Animations
  - None of the site animations are currently functioning
  - Review animation triggers, libraries, and dependencies to ensure they load correctly.

- Gallery
  - Implement a **scrollable image gallery** or carousel for better visual flow.

- Card Hover Effects
  - Add **hover animations** to cards for interactivity and a modern touch.

- Events Database (Optional)
  - Consider creating a **database or JSON file** for managing upcoming events
  - If not, we can **manually update** events weekly
