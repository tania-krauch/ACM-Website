## UI / Design Improvements

- Hero Section (Top Banner)
  - Replace the current screen recording background with a **custom animated ASCII-style background**, inspired by the **VS Code website animation** [https://code.visualstudio.com/]
  - Create our own version that fits the ACM brand and color scheme

- Cards and Layout
  - Fix **vertical spacing** between cards on **mobile view** — currently, some cards blend together
  - The **calendar section spacing is the standard** 

- Footer: Social media
  - Adjust **spacing and alignment**
  - Add or fix **icon links** (socials, GitHub, contact, etc.)


## Functionality & Features

- Gallery
  - Improve the scroll flow

- Events Database (Optional)
  - Consider creating a **database or JSON file** for managing upcoming events
  - If not, we can **manually update** events weekly
